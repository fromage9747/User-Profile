# User-Profile
I take no credit in this code, only correcting it.  

Original code can be found on https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/User-Profile.  

I merely spent some time going through his code and debugging the errors.

Download and place in your WAMP, XAMP directory.

Create a schema called userprofile and execute the SQL code in _sqlfile to create the table and columns.

Modify the _database file to connect to your mysql database and away you go!
